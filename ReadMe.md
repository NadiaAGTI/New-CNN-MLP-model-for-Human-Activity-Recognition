To execute the code, you must:

1. Charge the datasets: UCI HAR, and WISDM, and put the correct path to the used datset (datasets are included in the Data directory).
2. Choose the adequate "Preprocessing" part.
For UCI HAR Datset:

  ```python
print('No duplicates in our training data: {}'.format(sum(train.duplicated())))
print('No of duplicates in our test data: {}'.format(sum(test.duplicated())))
4. Execute the code regularly.
